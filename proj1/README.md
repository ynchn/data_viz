# Project 1 - Data Exploration Concept & MySQL Query

This project is an exploration of books and media regarding LGBTQ topics in the Seattle Public Library, how they are represented and categorized by the library, as well as how the publicâ€™s interest in them have changed throughout the years.\
The results from the queries revealed interesting patterns in the data. Overall, the data from Seattle Public Library reflected attitudes toward and interests in LGBTQ identities and the community rather accurately. The checkout records shows increasing public interest in learning about the LGBTQ community, which may lead to more acceptance in our society. The data also validated that the increase in positive queer legislation, advocacy, and discourse in recent years was able to help diversity queer identities gain more recognition and acknowledgement.

MySQL queries made to the Seattle Public Library databases in MySQLWorkbench. Part of data aggregation and data visualization done with Matplotlib and pandas.
